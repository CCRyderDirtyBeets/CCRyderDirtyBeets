# Hello! My name is Ari Guzzi. I built this website for Chris Cullen while in my introduction to web design class.
## My website is https://ari-guzzi.com
Now that I finished building this website for Chris, I want to leave instructions about how he can add images and youtube videos in the future.

Dear Chris,
    I know this is not necessarily ideal, but I am not sure of a better way to do this yet. 
    
### Step 1: You need to do is download some software on your computer that you can code on. 
    My favorite is called Visual Studio Code. 
    - Follow this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

### Step 2: You need to download github desktop.
    - follow this link: https://desktop.github.com/
    This is how you will move your code from your computer to the internet.
    - Once it is downloaded, open it and sign into github

### Step 3: You need to download the code onto your computer!
    - After signing in, click on the "File" menu and select "Clone Repository."
    - In the pop-up, choose the "URL" tab and enter https://github.com/CCRyderDirtyBeets/CCRyderDirtyBeets.git
    - Select a location on your computer where you want the code to live and click "Clone." (ie desktop)
    
### Step 4: Updating the Website!!!
    - Open GitHub Desktop.
    - In the left sidebar, select the repository: CCRyderandDirtyBeets
    - Add new photos or videos into the images folder within the CCRyderandDirtyBeets that should have appeared whereever you placed it in step 3

### Step 5: Write code!
    This is where things may get tricky. 
    - Open the file index.html
    - Scroll down until you see "<!--Add more youtube videos here" or "<!--Add more images here" depending what you want to do. 
    hint: the text will be one color and a different color than everything else (probably green)
    - Follow the instructions listed within those <!-- --> symbols that are a different color

    - In GitHub Desktop, you'll see the changes listed in the "Changes" tab.
    - Write a brief summary in the "Summary" field (ie "added photo or video") and click on the "Commit to main" button.
    - Finally, click on the "Push origin" button to upload the changes to the website!!!

### Step 6: Wait a couple minutes and it should appear on your website!
